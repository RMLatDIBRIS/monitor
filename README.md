Support for singleton event type patterns, to replace prefixing (will be kept anyway for legacy reasons)

# monitor

The monitor generated by the compiler from an **RML** specification is implemented in [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/), so you need to install it. Version 7+ required.

To verify a trace `trace.txt` against a compiled specification `spec.pl`:

    $ monitor.sh spec.pl trace.txt
